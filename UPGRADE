If you see this error...

[2012/01/17 08:57:59 PST] [EROR] (tritium/linker.(*LinkingContext).ProcessInstructionWithLocalScope:165) No such function found: Text.fetch,Text in file /Users/hcatlin/dev/moov/tritium/packages/libxml/test/complex/irl/bn_home/pages/browse/product-details.ts:0

It means that in the file product-details.ts, there is a function call fetch() that is happening in a Text scope
instead of a Node scope (where you can fetch from.) Upon inspection, you will find this...


    inner_wrap("span") {
      text() {
        set(fetch("img/@alt"))
      }
    }

The problem is, inside of text(), we are in a Text scope... and we can't fetch() from there.
So, we just rework it a bit to be....

    inner_wrap("span") {
      text(fetch("img/@alt"))
    }

See, here fetch() is called outside of the text() scope. And, we just pass it in as the first argument.
If an argument wasn't an option, we could have done this...

    inner_wrap("span") {
      %alt = fetch("img/@alt")
      text() {
        set(%alt)
      }
    }

The two are basically equivalent.

Tritium is a magical language that functions as a document modifying language.
It's JavaScript-like (except, without all that function() noise!) and simple to
learn.

Currently, it focuses on modifying XML documents only (HTML and XHTML count too). 

Check out the examples in /test/functional to get started... but basically.

  <html>
    <body>
      <div id="awesome" />
    </body>
  </html>
  
If you pass that in as an input to the following script.

  $("/html/body/div[@id='awesome']") {
    attribute("class", "even_awesomer!")
    wrap("div", class: "wrapper")
  }

You'd get back...

  <html>
    <body>
      <div class="wrapper">
        <div id="awesome" class="even_awesomer!"/>
      </div>
    </body>
  </html>

Engines! The Reference, Debug, and Standard engine are bundled for now.
Other engines must be managed seperately.
